We test different ways of aggregating economic, cultural, and European integration issues to determine which configuration best captures voter preferences across all member states. Our findings show that combining economic and cultural issues into a left-right ``super-dimension'' alongside a separate dimension for European integration generally offers the most accurate representation across time and space. However, regional variations reveal that this model performs better in Western Europe compared to Central/Eastern Europe, where other models may fit better. To address these regional disparities, we recommend implementing more rigorous pre-testing of common items and considering country-specific or regional adaptations in scaling. These measures could enhance the relevance and precision of VAAs, ensuring they effectively reflect the political landscapes of diverse European regions.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"One model to rule them all?

Arguably, populist parties contribute to the representation of underrepresented constituencies by taking stances that non-populist parties are too constrained to advocate and make a promise of extreme responsiveness to those frustrated with the lack of representation. In this research note, we investigate whether populist parties are indeed closer to their voters in the policy space than non-populist parties (thus closing representation gaps) and are more congruent with their constituencies than the other parties are with theirs. Using data from Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, we find that populist right parties are indeed closer to their voters than the other parties, but the correspondence between their positions and those of their constituencies is on average as good or bad as that between other parties and their voters.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"Do populist parties better represent their voters than mainstream parties?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, trust was widely identified as key for mitigation of the crisis through its influence on compliance with public policy, vaccination and many other social attitudes and behaviours. We study whether trust did indeed matter through a meta-analysis of 68 studies and 428 individual effect sizes derived from 1,479,154 observations from around the world. Political trust has small to moderate correlations with outcomes such as vaccine uptake, belief in conspiracy theories, and compliance. These correlations are heterogenous, and we show that trust in health authorities is more strongly related to vaccination than trust in government is; on the contrary, we show that compliance is more strongly related to government than other institutions. Moreover, the unique case of the United States indicates that trust in President Trump had negative effects across all observed outcomes. Our analysis also shows that research design features (such as response scales) and publication bias do not importantly change the results. These results indicate that trust was important for the management of the pandemic and supports existing work highlighting the importance of political trust.","tags":["Political trust"],"title":"Political trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis of 67 studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description This project presents an easy to use R function to automatically download key data and textual information on EU laws from the European Parliament\u0026rsquo;s Legislative Observatory and EUR-Lex websites.\nIt downloads most of the information available on the procedure page, complements it with data from the EUR-Lex website, and stores it in a dataframe that can subsequently be saved by the user in the preferred format (see documentation).\nUsage The raw script can be downloaded from this link otherwise it can be accessed directly from the R workspace as per the instructions in the documentation.\nA minimal report about the information extracted can be found here.\nAn updated version of the dataset with the procedures from 1994 onwards is available upon request.\nCitation The raw code is publicly accessible and free to download, adapt, and use.

Yet, whilst the literature on central banks' legislative oversight has expanded, the role of the media as account holders has been left largely unexplored. We assess media scrutiny by using an original dataset of news articles about the Bank of England published between 1997 and 2020, and by analysing the relationship between central banking outcomes and scrutiny in the form of evaluative and negative coverage of the Bank. We find that the variation in such coverage can be traced back to policy outcomes, but the association is largely confined to the post-crisis period. The findings support a view of the media as instrumental in central bank oversight, but also show the limits of this form of accountability.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"Do the media scrutinise central banking?

In particular, the chart shows the evolution of support for EU integration since the 1970s (or since the year a country joined the EU).\nThe measures refer to the overall support for the European Union and to the support for European integration in the following areas:\nasylum and immigration policies; fiscal and economic affairs; internal market and consumer policies; social and welfare policies. The measures are constructed using a Bayesian approach to item response theory. In short, I treat support for European integration as a latent \u0026lsquo;attribute\u0026rsquo; that respondents possess, more or less as if it was a skill. Now, imagine we want to measure respondents\u0026rsquo; (latent) support for the EU by asking them a few questions related to different aspects of EU support. Again, more or less as if we would like to capture their mathematical knowledge by asking questions about algebra and so on. We know that the probability that they answer in a pro-European way is determined by three factors:\nall things being equal, the higher the individual\u0026rsquo;s latent support for the EU, the more likely she is to give a pro-EU answer to the question asked. additionally, each question has its intrinsic difficulty. For instance, we would expect it to be more \u0026lsquo;difficult\u0026rsquo; to answer in a pro-European way to a question asking whether the EU should become a federation rather than to a question asking whether more EU action is needed on matters related to development cooperation. Whenever a respondent\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;pro-Europeaness\u0026rsquo; exceeds the difficulty of the question, she is more likely to show support for EU integration rather than opposition. changes in the respondent\u0026rsquo;s latent support for Europe affect the likelihood of answering in a pro-European way, but the effect of these changes is not constant across all the questions. For example, some questions are more indicative of the underlying latent support, whereas other are just weakly reflective of latent support. This property is called question discrimination. In an ideal situation, by knowing each question\u0026rsquo;s difficulty (point 2 above) and discrimination (point 3), as well as the distribution of latent EU support in the population (point 1), it would be possible to predict the percentage of pro-European responses to a specific question asked at a given point in time. Yet, we find ourselves precisely in the opposite situation. In fact, we could use available survey data only to know what is the true number of pro-European responses given to a specific question.\nTherefore, a Bayesian approach is used to proceed \u0026lsquo;backwards\u0026rsquo; and to determine the most likely values of the question\u0026rsquo;s difficulty and discrimination, as well as the level of latent EU support, given the observed response patterns. More technically, Bayesian item response theory starts from some (whatever vague) prior information about the probability distribution of these unknown quantities, then looks at the observed data (survey responses) and estimates the probability that the data could be generated by a process with a given combination of these unknown quantities.\nTo implement the Bayesian model, I identify 201 Eurobarometer questions tapping into support for the European Union, which were asked at least twice since September 1973. A first category of questions comprises items on trust in the EU or in its institutions, the evaluation of one\u0026rsquo;s country membership in the EU, and dispositions towards European unification. A second and bigger (about 81%) category of questions, instead, measures preferences for the level of government which should be responsible for a particular policy, whether the EU should do more or less in a certain field, and whether the respondent favours or opposes the creation of an EU common policy in a given domain More detailed information about the methodology and the raw survey questions used for the estimation can be found in this article.\nThe chart is updated with survey data collected up to 2020.\n","date":1649116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649116800,"objectID":"4fbf64d3adfb0eb135237e4bb94f3691","permalink":"https://mscottodivettimo.github.io/project/irt_opinion/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/irt_opinion/","section":"project","summary":"This post aims at tracking the level of support for European integration over a very long time frame in all the member states of the European Union.
