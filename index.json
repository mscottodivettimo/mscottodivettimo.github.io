The organizations are meant to avoid traditional policy responsiveness, but still have processes in place to take into account societal views. Our study analyzes how pressure on technocratic bodies affects the audience orientation of their policy explanations. Taking a reputational perspective, we argue that the policy explanations provided by technocrats whose legitimacy depends on their outcomes will be influenced by performance-based reputational threats. We hypothesize that such threats—whether based on perceptions or performance indicators—lead technocrats to orient themselves more toward the wider public, which we operationalize as accessibility and people centeredness of the language. We test our hypotheses on a new dataset of speeches of members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (1997–2024). Though accessibility cannot be traced back to performance-based threats, people centeredness is affected. Yet, while negative performance-based perceptions are associated with more people-centered policy explanation, negative measured performance leads technocrats to center less on people. Our findings contribute to the literature on reputation, audience orientation, and communicative responsiveness, and suggest differential effects based on whether performance is perceived or measured.","tags":["Central banks","Responsiveness"],"title":"Technocrats, Reputation, and Responsiveness in Policy Explanation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description This project presents an easy to use R function to automatically download key data and textual information on EU laws from the European Parliament\u0026rsquo;s Legislative Observatory and EUR-Lex websites.\nIt downloads most of the information available on the procedure page, complements it with data from the EUR-Lex website, and stores it in a dataframe that can subsequently be saved by the user in the preferred format (see documentation).\nUsage The raw script can be downloaded from this link otherwise it can be accessed directly from the R workspace as per the instructions in the documentation.\nA minimal report about the information extracted can be found here.\nAn updated version of the dataset with the procedures initiated from 1993 onwards is available upon request.\nCitation The raw code is publicly accessible and free to download, adapt, and use.

Yet, researchers who want to utilise these data face several challenges. This paper presents the results of a community-wide survey tapping into various research challenges, training needs and preferences of scholars using text analysis methodologies. The survey involved respondents from various academic fields and career levels. Our findings indicate that text-as-data methods are gaining momentum in various political sciences subfields and are used on a wide range of political texts. However, relevant training is not easily accessible to all. Only half of the respondents have ever participated in a training event, though there is a high demand for training opportunities, both in different formats and at different levels. In the conclusions we discuss how the inaccessibility of training risks narrowing the field of researchers.","tags":["Text-as-data"],"title":"Research Challenges and Training Needs in Text Analysis for Political Science Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrei Zhirnov","Jan Philipp Thomeczek","Michele Scotto di Vettimo","Alberto Lopez Ortega","Andre Krouwel","Lorenza Antonucci","Roberta Di Stefano","Norbert Kersting"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1738195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738195200,"objectID":"d0380e4c4421188e5baa30f4f377b7dd","permalink":"https://michelescottodivettimo.eu/publication/2025_es_populist/","publishdate":"2025-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025_es_populist/","section":"publication","summary":"The rise of populism in Europe has often been described as a response to representation deficits. Arguably, populist parties contribute to the representation of underrepresented constituencies by taking stances that non-populist parties are too constrained to advocate and make a promise of extreme responsiveness to those frustrated with the lack of representation. In this research note, we investigate whether populist parties are indeed closer to their voters in the policy space than non-populist parties (thus closing representation gaps) and are more congruent with their constituencies than the other parties are with theirs. Using data from Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, we find that populist right parties are indeed closer to their voters than the other parties, but the correspondence between their positions and those of their constituencies is on average as good or bad as that between other parties and their voters.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"Do populist parties better represent their voters than mainstream parties?

Yet, whilst the literature on central banks' legislative oversight has expanded, the role of the media as account holders has been left largely unexplored. We assess media scrutiny by using an original dataset of news articles about the Bank of England published between 1997 and 2020, and by analysing the relationship between central banking outcomes and scrutiny in the form of evaluative and negative coverage of the Bank. We find that the variation in such coverage can be traced back to policy outcomes, but the association is largely confined to the post-crisis period. The findings support a view of the media as instrumental in central bank oversight, but also show the limits of this form of accountability.","tags":["Publication"],"title":"Do the media scrutinise central banking? Evidence from the Bank of England","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This post aims at tracking the level of support for European integration over a very long time frame in all the member states of the European Union. In particular, the chart shows the evolution of support for EU integration since the 1970s (or since the year a country joined the EU).\nThe measures refer to the overall support for the European Union and to the support for European integration in the following areas:\nasylum and immigration policies; fiscal and economic affairs; internal market and consumer policies; social and welfare policies. The measures are constructed using a Bayesian approach to item response theory. In short, I treat support for European integration as a latent \u0026lsquo;attribute\u0026rsquo; that respondents possess, more or less as if it was a skill. Now, imagine we want to measure respondents\u0026rsquo; (latent) support for the EU by asking them a few questions related to different aspects of EU support. Again, more or less as if we would like to capture their mathematical knowledge by asking questions about algebra and so on. We know that the probability that they answer in a pro-European way is determined by three factors:\nall things being equal, the higher the individual\u0026rsquo;s latent support for the EU, the more likely she is to give a pro-EU answer to the question asked. additionally, each question has its intrinsic difficulty. For instance, we would expect it to be more \u0026lsquo;difficult\u0026rsquo; to answer in a pro-European way to a question asking whether the EU should become a federation rather than to a question asking whether more EU action is needed on matters related to development cooperation. Whenever a respondent\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;pro-Europeaness\u0026rsquo; exceeds the difficulty of the question, she is more likely to show support for EU integration rather than opposition. changes in the respondent\u0026rsquo;s latent support for Europe affect the likelihood of answering in a pro-European way, but the effect of these changes is not constant across all the questions. For example, some questions are more indicative of the underlying latent support, whereas other are just weakly reflective of latent support. This property is called question discrimination. In an ideal situation, by knowing each question\u0026rsquo;s difficulty (point 2 above) and discrimination (point 3), as well as the distribution of latent EU support in the population (point 1), it would be possible to predict the percentage of pro-European responses to a specific question asked at a given point in time. Yet, we find ourselves precisely in the opposite situation. In fact, we could use available survey data only to know what is the true number of pro-European responses given to a specific question.\nTherefore, a Bayesian approach is used to proceed \u0026lsquo;backwards\u0026rsquo; and to determine the most likely values of the question\u0026rsquo;s difficulty and discrimination, as well as the level of latent EU support, given the observed response patterns. More technically, Bayesian item response theory starts from some (whatever vague) prior information about the probability distribution of these unknown quantities, then looks at the observed data (survey responses) and estimates the probability that the data could be generated by a process with a given combination of these unknown quantities.\nTo implement the Bayesian model, I identify 201 Eurobarometer questions tapping into support for the European Union, which were asked at least twice since September 1973. A first category of questions comprises items on trust in the EU or in its institutions, the evaluation of one\u0026rsquo;s country membership in the EU, and dispositions towards European unification. A second and bigger (about 81%) category of questions, instead, measures preferences for the level of government which should be responsible for a particular policy, whether the EU should do more or less in a certain field, and whether the respondent favours or opposes the creation of an EU common policy in a given domain More detailed information about the methodology and the raw survey questions used for the estimation can be found in this article.\nThe chart is updated with survey data collected up to 2020.\n","date":1649116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649116800,"objectID":"4fbf64d3adfb0eb135237e4bb94f3691","permalink":"https://michelescottodivettimo.eu/project/irt_opinion/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/irt_opinion/","section":"project","summary":"This post aims at tracking the level of support for European integration over a very long time frame in all the member states of the European Union.
